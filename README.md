# Snake_water_gun-game
Snake Water Gun is a two-player(computer and you) game where players choose between: snake, water, or gun. The player who plays the strongest "object" wins. The results are:
  Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water and wins.
  Water vs. Gun: The gun drowns in water, giving a point to water.
  Gun vs. Snake: Gun kills the snake and wins.
  Draw: If both players choose the same object, the result is a draw.
